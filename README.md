SlitScan are imaging techniques used to create static images of time-based phenomena. In traditional film photography, 
slit scan images are created by exposing film as it slides past a slit-shaped aperture. In the digital realm, a thin slice of pixels is extracted 
from a sequence of video frames, and concatenated into the creation of a new image; moving the line from top to bottom and not re-drawing the background, we can see a trace of the changes in the color. So, the line of pixels leaves a trace of the  morphed 'time' in the space of the frame.
The sound processing is a granulation of a 3D printer's operating sound that is influenced by the pixel colours at the current scan point from the video input.

## Soft Spaces:

It is a series of classic video processing algorithms that uses the webcam input as a source and the browser as performance space; 
they helps us to rediscover the affordances of movement and perception augmented by computational systems and algorithmic compositional strategies. The space of the frame is choreographed and remapped in coupling with the camera of user/performer. Soft Spaces represent the cognitive continuity of software creation,  interface design and embodiment. They conceived as invitations are invitations to create and compose in front of the computer. How do they  make you move?" 

Created for MotionDAO experiments in NFTs that invite to move.
